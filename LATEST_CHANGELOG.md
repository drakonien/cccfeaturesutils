# Changelog

## 1.10.0 (2020-09-02)

### Added

- A new funtionality:
  - `GetTestParameters`: to get the initial structure of a test json file. It reads info from the `Task.json` file of a task, opens a new file and writes the info in the new file. If using contextual menu, the option only appears on `task.json` files.

### Fixed

- A typo in the README in the `Get Parameters` functionality.
